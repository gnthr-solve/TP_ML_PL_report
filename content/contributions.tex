\section{Contributions}

Fundamentally this project was a team effort. All members were involved in the necessary literature research and the design ideas for the pipeline to some extent.
There was no clear task separation in the process but in the design of the pipeline and the final report the major contributions were as follows:\\

\textbf{Artemii Redkin:} Design of the first pipeline approach, its implementation and description as well as description of balancers and classifiers in the report.\\

\textbf{Zekiye Erarslan:} Additional research, setup of the reference management and introduction and description of balancers and classifiers in the report.\\

\textbf{Matteo Zannini:} Hypothesis testing and regression for pipeline results and their description, setup of the report repository and its infrastructure.\\

\textbf{Manuel GÃ¼nther:} Design of the custom generator and the second and third pipeline approach, their implementation and description, 
as well as experiment design and metrics in the report.\\
