abstract = {The functioning of electromyogram (EMG) driven prosthesis to control the performance of artificial prosthetic arms placed on people with missing limbs depends on the cumulative effect of multiple dynamic factors, some of which include electrode placement position, muscle contraction levels, forearm orientations, etc. However, the study of the combined influence of these dynamic factors has been limited and hence offered us scope to improve the accuracy of the previous studies. We used the data to extract multiple features through the Time Dependent Power Spectrum Descriptor (TD-PSD) algorithm, which has proven to be one of the best methods of feature extraction. Samples are classified using the Neural Pattern Recognition Toolbox with scaled conjugate gradient backpropagation as the training algorithm, which gives an improved accuracy over Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Neural Network is trained using the EMG signals of 10 subjects performing multiple hand movements to achieve classification accuracy up to 94.7%. The results obtained are a testimony to the fact that the suggested method is competent to improve the operation of pattern recognition myoelectric signals.},

abstract = {Extending previous work on quantile classifiers (q-classifiers) we propose the q*-classifier for the class imbalance problem. The classifier assigns a sample to the minority class if the minority class conditional probability exceeds 0 < q* < 1, where q* equals the unconditional probability of observing a minority class sample. The motivation for q*-classification stems from a density-based approach and leads to the useful property that the q*-classifier maximizes the sum of the true positive and true negative rates. Moreover, because the procedure can be equivalently expressed as a cost-weighted Bayes classifier, it also minimizes weighted risk. Because of this dual optimization, the q*-classifier can achieve near zero risk in imbalance problems, while simultaneously optimizing true positive and true negative rates. We use random forests to apply q*-classification. This new method which we call RFQ is shown to outperform or is competitive with existing techniques with respect to G-mean performance and variable selection. Extensions to the multiclass imbalanced setting are also considered.},

abstract = {For the last two decades, oversampling has been employed to overcome the challenge of learning from imbalanced datasets. Many approaches to solving this challenge have been offered in the literature. Oversampling, on the other hand, is a concern. That is, models trained on fictitious data may fail spectacularly when put to real-world problems. The fundamental difficulty with oversampling approaches is that, given a real-life population, the synthesized samples may not truly belong to the minority class. As a result, training a classifier on these samples while pretending they represent minority may result in incorrect predictions when the model is used in the real world. We analyzed a large number of oversampling methods in this paper and devised a new oversampling evaluation system based on hiding a number of majority examples and comparing them to those generated by the oversampling process. Based on our evaluation system, we ranked all these methods based on their incorrectly generated examples for comparison. Our experiments using more than 70 oversampling methods and nine imbalanced real-world datasets reveal that all oversampling methods studied generate minority samples that are most likely to be majority. Given data and methods in hand, we argue that oversampling in its current forms and methodologies is unreliable for learning from class imbalanced data and should be avoided in real-world applications.},

@article{Xu2020,
abstract = {The problem of imbalanced data classification often exists in medical diagnosis. Traditional classification algorithms usually assume that the number of samples in each class is similar and their misclassification cost during training is equal. However, the misclassification cost of patient samples is higher than that of healthy person samples. Therefore, how to increase the identification of patients without affecting the classification of healthy individuals is an urgent problem. In order to solve the problem of imbalanced data classification in medical diagnosis, we propose a hybrid sampling algorithm called RFMSE, which combines the Misclassification-oriented Synthetic minority over-sampling technique (M-SMOTE) and Edited nearset neighbor (ENN) based on Random forest (RF). The algorithm is mainly composed of three parts. First, M-SMOTE is used to increase the number of samples in the minority class, while the over-sampling rate of M-SMOTE is the misclassification rate of RF. Then, ENN is used to remove the noise ones from the majority samples. Finally, RF is used to perform classification prediction for the samples after hybrid sampling, and the stopping criterion for iterations is determined according to the changes of the classification index (i.e. Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)). When the value of MCC continuously drops, the process of iterations will be stopped. Extensive experiments conducted on ten UCI datasets demonstrate that RFMSE can effectively solve the problem of imbalanced data classification. Compared with traditional algorithms, our method can improve F-value and MCC more effectively.},

@article{Khushi2021,
abstract = {Medical datasets are usually imbalanced, where negative cases severely outnumber positive cases. Therefore, it is essential to deal with this data skew problem when training machine learning algorithms. This study uses two representative lung cancer datasets, PLCO and NLST, with imbalance ratios (the proportion of samples in the majority class to those in the minority class) of 24.7 and 25.0, respectively, to predict lung cancer incidence. This research uses the performance of 23 class imbalance methods (resampling and hybrid systems) with three classical classifiers (logistic regression, random forest, and LinearSVC) to identify the best imbalance techniques suitable for medical datasets. Resampling includes ten under-sampling methods (RUS, etc.), seven over-sampling methods (SMOTE, etc.), and two integrated sampling methods (SMOTEENN, SMOTE-Tomek). Hybrid systems include (Balanced Bagging, etc.). The results show that class imbalance learning can improve the classification ability of the model. Compared with other imbalanced techniques, under-sampling techniques have the highest standard deviation (SD), and over-sampling techniques have the lowest SD. Over-sampling is a stable method, and the AUC in the model is generally higher than in other ways. Using ROS, the random forest performs the best predictive ability and is more suitable for the lung cancer datasets used in this study. The code is available at https://mkhushi.github.io/},

@article{Fotouhi2019,
abstract = {The early diagnosis of cancer, as one of the major causes of death, is vital for cancerous patients. Diagnosing diseases in general and cancer in particular is a considerable application of data analysis for medical science. However, imbalanced data distribution and imbalanced quality of the majority and minority classes, which lead to misclassification, is a great challenge in this field. Though the samples of the majority class and their proper classification are more important to classifier, cancer is diagnosed by relying on the minority class samples (cancer data class). While the consequence of wrong diagnosis for non-cancerous patients is several additional clinical tests, the cancerous patients pay the price of wrong diagnosis with their lives. As such, studying the class imbalance problem is vital from the medical's perspective. To serve this purpose, a comprehensive study on the consequences of imbalanced data problem is performed in this paper on the data of cancer patients for the first time. In this context, oversampling and under sampling as two main balancing techniques including 18 algorithms are employed. The techniques used in oversampling are ADASYN, ADOMS, AHC, Borderline-SMOTE, ROS, Safe-Level-SMOTE, SMOTE, SMOTE-ENN, SMOTE-TL, SPIDER and SPIDER2, while under sampling techniques are CNN, CNNTL, NCL, OSS, RUS, SBC and TL. To examine the impact of balancers on the performance of classifiers, four classifiers named RIPPER, MLP, KNN, and C4.5 are employed as learners. In addition, 15 cancer data sets from SEER program used for the study are kidney, soft tissue, bladder, rectum, colon, bone, larynx, breast, cervix, prostate, oropharynx, melanoma, thyroid, testis, and lip. The findings of the study are centered on examining the impact of class imbalance on the function of classifiers, a general comparing of the function of pre-processing techniques and classifying all data sets and finally determining the best balancer and classifier for each kind of cancer data set. According to the results, significant improvement is obtained through using balancers. Assessing by AUC, the performance of different classifiers of cancer imbalanced data sets has improved in 90% of the cases after using balancing techniques. To be more precise, Friedman statistical tests are applied and interestingly, each kind of cancer data set responded differently to different balancing techniques and classifiers. Moreover, considering the mean rank of each technique and classifier that were used for data sets, oversampling balancing techniques result in better outcomes than under sampling ones.},

It is also found that SVM in conjunction with SMOTE performs better than with ADASYN as the degree of class imbalance increases.

abstract = {This paper presents a novel adaptive synthetic (ADASYN) sampling approach for learning from imbalanced data sets. The essential idea of ADASYN is to use a weighted distribution for different minority class examples according to their level of difficulty in learning, where more synthetic data is generated for minority class examples that are harder to learn compared to those minority examples that are easier to learn. As a result, the ADASYN approach improves learning with respect to the data distributions in two ways: (1) reducing the bias introduced by the class imbalance, and (2) adaptively shifting the classification decision boundary toward the difficult examples. Simulation analyses on several machine learning data sets show the effectiveness of this method across five evaluation metrics. {\textcopyright}2008 IEEE.},

@article{Liu2022,
abstract = {Background: Imbalance between positive and negative outcomes, a so-called class imbalance, is a problem generally found in medical data. Despite various studies, class imbalance has always been a difficult issue. The main objective of this study was to find an effective integrated approach to address the problems posed by class imbalance and to validate the method in an early screening model for a rare cardiovascular disease aortic dissection (AD). Methods: Different data-level methods, cost-sensitive learning, and the bagging method were combined to solve the problem of low sensitivity caused by the imbalance of two classes of data. First, feature selection was applied to select the most relevant features using statistical analysis, including significance test and logistic regression. Then, we assigned two different misclassification cost values for two classes, constructed weak classifiers based on the support vector machine (SVM) model, and integrated the weak classifiers with undersampling and bagging methods to build the final strong classifier. Due to the rarity of AD, the data imbalance was particularly prominent. Therefore, we applied our method to the construction of an early screening model for AD disease. Clinical data of 523,213 patients from the Institute of Hypertension, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University were used to verify the validity of this method. In these data, the sample ratio of AD patients to non-AD patients was 1:65, and each sample contained 71 features. Results: The proposed ensemble model achieved the highest sensitivity of 82.8%, with training time and specificity reaching 56.4 s and 71.9% respectively. Additionally, it obtained a small variance of sensitivity of 19.58 × 10–3 in the seven-fold cross validation experiment. The results outperformed the common ensemble algorithms of AdaBoost, EasyEnsemble, and Random Forest (RF) as well as the single machine learning (ML) methods of logistic regression, decision tree, k nearest neighbors (KNN), back propagation neural network (BP) and SVM. Among the five single ML algorithms, the SVM model after cost-sensitive learning method performed best with a sensitivity of 79.5% and a specificity of 73.4%. Conclusions: In this study, we demonstrate that the integration of feature selection, undersampling, cost-sensitive learning and bagging methods can overcome the challenge of class imbalance in a medical dataset and develop a practical screening model for AD, which could lead to a decision support for screening for AD at an early stage.},

@article{Tarawneh2020,
abstract = {Class imbalance occurs in classification problems in which the 'normal' cases, or instances, significantly outnumber the 'abnormal' instances. Training a standard classifier on imbalanced data leads to predictive biases which cause poor performance on the class(es) with lower prior probabilities. The less frequent classes are often critically important events, such as system failure or the occurrence of a rare disease. As a result, the class imbalance problem has been considered to be of great importance for many years. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that utilizes the furthest neighbor of a candidate example to generate new synthetic samples. A key advantage of SOMTEFUNA over existing methods is that it does not have parameters to tune (such as K in SMOTE). Thus, it is significantly easier to utilize in real-world applications. We evaluate the benefit of resampling with SOMTEFUNA against state-of-the-art methods including SMOTE, ADASYN and SWIM using Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine classifiers. Also, we provide a statistical analysis based on Wilcoxon Signed-rank test to validate the significance of the SMOTEFUNA results. The results indicate that the proposed method is an efficient alternative to the current methods. Specifically, SOMTEFUNA achieves better 5-fold cross validated ROC and precision-recall space performance.},

@article{Chawla2002,
abstract = {An approach to the construction of classifiers from unbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of "normal" examples with only a small percentage of "abnormal" or "interesting" examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex hull strategy. {\textcopyright} 2002 AI Access Foundation and Morgan Kaufmann Publishers.

Data-level and algorithm-level methods are constantly being improved and hybrid approaches gain increasing popularity. Recent trends focus on analyzing not only the disproportion between classes, but also other difficulties embedded in the nature of data.

Seven vital areas of research in this topic are identified, covering the full spectrum of learning from imbalanced data: classification, regression, clustering, data streams, big data analytics and applications, e.g., in social media and computer vision.
